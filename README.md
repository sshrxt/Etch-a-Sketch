# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project inspired by the odin project. Users first load the webpage, in which they are greeted with a sketch box and some tools for them to sketch. The webpage includes functionailities including selecting your own color, a random color, eraser, and reset. I plan to add the toggle grid feature soon!
